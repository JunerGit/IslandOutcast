# IslandOutcast
# A 3D Java Game-Prototype made with jMonkeyEngine.

The aim of this project is to develop a 3D game. The topic of the game is to survive in a realistic world. The player should be able to interact with animals, resources and the environment to fulfill all vital parameters. This includes tasks like creating fire, searching for food and protection from environmental influences.  

The result of this thesis is a software product, which allows the user to move in a randomly generated 3D environment and to interact with his surroundings. The 3D environment represents an island, which can be explored by the player but not left. Additionally, the island is inhabited by wild animals, which move around freely while avoiding the player.
