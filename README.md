# IslandOutcast
The aim of this project is to develop a 3D game. The topic of the game is to survive in a realistic world. The player should be able to interact with animals, resources and the environment to fulfill all vital parameters. This includes tasks like creating fire, searching for food and protection from environmental influences.  As the development of a 3D engine is very time consuming and complex, an already existing game engine was used. There --were numerous free game engines like Unity and jMonkey, but the latter was chosen because it is based on the programming language Java. Incremental software development was used as the development method. Since this project is a software project, existing programming knowledge as well as fundamental algorithms and programming techniques have been used. Furthermore an advanced knowledge of mathematical understanding, especially in geometry, was required. Therefore the existing knowledge was extended through external investigation. The result of this thesis is a software product, which allows the user to move in a randomly generated 3D environment and to interact with his surroundings. The 3D environment represents an island, which can be explored by the player but not left. Additionally, the island is inhabited by wild animals, which move around freely while avoiding the player.
